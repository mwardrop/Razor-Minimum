Razor Minimum
==========================================

This is the minimum requirements to get IIS to execute a Razor template file (.cshtml).

Use this with IIS Express to quickly demo C# code without having to spool up an ASP.NET project in Visual Studio.

**Instructions:**

1) Clone Repo

      `git clone https://github.com/mwardrop/Razor-Minimum`
      
2) Run IIS Express against the directory you cloned to

      `C:\Program Files\IIS Express\iisexpress.exe /path:C:\REPOPATH`

3) Navigate to the example index.cshtml

      `http://localhost:8080/index.cshtml`
